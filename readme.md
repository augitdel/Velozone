## Github usage
### Pulling Code
To get the latest code from github, run the following command:

    git pull

### Pushing Code
After making changes to the code, you can commit the changes. A commit makes a local 'checkpoint':

    git add .
    git commit -m 'some message'

When a commit is made, it is still in your local repository. You don't necessarily need to perform a push after each commit. You can either choose to keep on coding or to push the commit to the remote repository (on github).

To push the code:

    git push
